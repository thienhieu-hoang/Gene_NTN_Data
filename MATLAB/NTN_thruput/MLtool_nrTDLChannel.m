%nrTDLChannel TR 38.901 or 38.811 Tapped Delay Line (TDL) channel
%   CHAN = nrTDLChannel creates a TDL MIMO fading channel System object,
%   CHAN. This object filters an input signal through the TDL MIMO channel
%   to obtain the channel-impaired signal. This object implements the
%   following aspects of TR 38.901:
%   * Section 7.7.2 Tapped Delay Line (TDL) models
%   * Section 7.7.3 Scaling of delays 
%   * Section 7.7.6 K-factor for LOS channel models
%   * Section 7.7.5.2 TDL extension: Applying a correlation matrix
%   This object also implements the following aspects of TR 38.811:
%   * Section 6.9.2 TDL models
%
%   CHAN = nrTDLChannel(Name,Value) creates a TDL MIMO channel object,
%   CHAN, with the specified property Name set to the specified Value. You
%   can specify additional name-value pair arguments in any order as
%   (Name1,Value1,...,NameN,ValueN).
%
%   Step method syntax for ChannelFiltering set to true:
%
%   Y = step(CHAN,X) filters the input signal X through a TDL MIMO fading
%   channel and returns the result in Y. The input X can be a double or
%   single precision data type scalar, vector, or 2-D matrix. X is of size
%   Ns-by-Nt, where Ns is the number of samples and Nt is the number of
%   transmit antennas. Y is the output signal of size Ns-by-Nr, where Nr is
%   the number of receive antennas. Y is of the same data type as the input
%   signal X.
% 
%   [Y,PATHGAINS] = step(CHAN,X) returns the MIMO channel path gains of the
%   underlying fading process in PATHGAINS. PATHGAINS is of size
%   Ns-by-Np-by-Nt-by-Nr, where Np is the number of paths. PATHGAINS is of
%   the same data type as the input signal X.
%
%   [Y,PATHGAINS,SAMPLETIMES] = step(CHAN,X) also returns the sample times
%   of the channel snapshots (1st dimension elements) of PATHGAINS.
%   SAMPLETIMES is of size Ns-by-1 and is of double precision data type
%   with real values. To use this syntax, set ChannelResponseOutput to
%   'path-gains'.
%
%   [Y,OFDMRESPONSE,OFFSET] = step(CHAN,X,CARRIER) returns the channel OFDM
%   response OFDMRESPONSE and the timing offset OFFSET in samples
%   associated to the strongest path in the channel. OFDMRESPONSE is a
%   K-by-N-by-Nr-by-Nt array where K is the number of subcarriers, N is the
%   number of OFDM symbols in the input waveform, Nr is the number of
%   receive antennas and Nt is the number of transmit antennas.
%   OFDMRESPONSE is calculated by applying OFDM demodulation to the channel
%   impulse response according to the carrier configuration object CARRIER.
%   To use this syntax, set ChannelResponseOutput to 'ofdm-response'.
%
%   Step method syntax for ChannelFiltering set to false:
%
%   [PATHGAINS,SAMPLETIMES] = step(CHAN) produces path gains PATHGAINS and
%   sample times SAMPLETIMES as described above, where the duration of the
%   fading process is given by the NumTimeSamples property. In this case
%   the object acts as a source of path gains and sample times without
%   filtering an input signal. The data type of PATHGAINS is specified by
%   the OutputDataType property. To use this syntax, set
%   ChannelResponseOutput to 'path-gains'.
%
%   [OFDMRESPONSE,OFFSET] = step(CHAN,CARRIER) returns the channel
%   frequency response OFDMRESPONSE and the timing offset OFFSET in samples
%   associated to the strongest path in the channel. OFDMRESPONSE is a
%   K-by-N-by-Nr-by-Nt array where K is the number of subcarriers, N is the
%   number of OFDM symbols in the input waveform, Nr is the number of
%   receive antennas and Nt is the number of transmit antennas. The number
%   of OFDM symbols N depends on the value of the NumTimeSamples property.
%   OFDMRESPONSE is calculated by applying OFDM demodulation to the channel
%   impulse response according to the carrier configuration object CARRIER.
%   To use this syntax, set ChannelResponseOutput to 'ofdm-response'.
% 
%   System objects may be called directly like a function instead of using
%   the step method. For example, y = step(obj,x) and y = obj(x) are
%   equivalent.
